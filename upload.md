# Upload and Export Highlights

This page offers two distinct functions for converting book highlights into CSV format, one for Kindle and another for iBook.

<br>

## Kindle

Upload an HTML file from the Kindle app for iOS to convert your book highlights into a downloadable CSV format.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    {% include upload.html %}
</div>

## iBooks

Paste your iBook highlights into a text area to convert them into a CSV file. This function extracts and organizes iBook highlights, omitting information like titles and authors.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    {% include ibook-paste.html %}
</div>
