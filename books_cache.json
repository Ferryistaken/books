            "In general, you will find no art or faculty that can analyse itself, therefore none that can approve or disapprove of itself. [2] The art of grammar is restricted to analysing and commenting on literature. Music is confined to the analysis of harmony. [3] Consequently neither of them analyses itself. Now, if you are writing to a friend, the art of grammar will help you decide what words to use; but it will not tell you whether it is a good idea to write to your friend in the first place. Music is no different; whether this is a good time to sing and play, or a bad one, the art of music by itself cannot decide.",

When will it blow from the west?\u00e2\u0080\u0099 \u00e2\u0080\u0098When it wants to, or rather when Aeolus wants it to; because God put Aeolus in charge of the winds, not you.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 [17] What should we do then?

            "What should we have ready at hand in a situation like this? The knowledge of what is mine and what is not mine, what I can and cannot do. [22] I must die. But must I die bawling? I must be put in chains\u00e2\u0080\u0093but moaning and groaning too? I must be exiled; but is there anything to keep me from going with a smile, calm and self-composed?",

[13] Such things are indifferent, are they not, and as nothing to us; and death no evil thing? Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t we akin to God, having come from him?

They merely signify that people are confused about what is good and what is bad. So should we be angry with them, or should we pity them instead? [4] Show them where they go wrong and you will find that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll reform.

If it can, however, then either teach it to me yourself, or let me learn it from someone who professes to know; [6] since I hope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose that if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m doing the wrong thing it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s by choice. So what else could explain my error but ignorance? [7] And wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you rather I be cured of that? When did anger, however, ever teach someone to play music or pilot a ship? Do you imagine that your anger is going to help teach me the far more complex business of life?\u00e2\u0080\u009d",
            "Death and pain are not frightening, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fear of pain and death we need to fear. Which is why we praise the poet who wrote, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Death is not fearful, but dying like a coward is.\u00e2\u0080\u0099",

[24] Do you want to live your life in fear, grief and anxiety? \u00e2\u0080\u0098Of course not.\u00e2\u0080\u0099 So no one in a state of constant fear is free either. By the same token, whoever has gained relief from grief, fear and anxiety has gained freedom.",
            "Material things per se are indifferent, but the use we make of them is not indifferent. [2] The question, then, is how to strike a balance between a calm and composed attitude on the one hand, and a conscientious outlook that is neither slack nor careless on the other.13 Model yourself on card players. [3] The chips don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter, and the cards don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter; how can I know what the deal will be?

But you always have to remember the ship and listen for the captain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s signal to return. When he calls, you have to drop everything, otherwise you could be bound and thrown on board like the livestock. So it is in life. If, instead of greens and shellfish, you have taken on a wife and child, so much the better. But when the captain calls, you must be prepared to leave them behind, and not give them another thought.",

            "Whenever anyone criticizes or wrongs you, remember that they are only doing or saying what they think is right. They cannot be guided by your views, only their own; so if their views are wrong, they are the ones who suffer insofar as they are misguided. I mean, if someone declares a true conjunctive proposition to be false, the proposition is unaffected, it is they who come off worse for having their ignorance exposed. With this in mind you will treat your critic with more compassion. Say to yourself each time, \u00e2\u0080\u0098He did what he believed was right.\u00e2\u0080\u0099"

[2] If conversation turns to a philosophical topic, keep silent for the most part, since you run the risk of spewing forth a lot of ill-digested information. If your silence is taken for ignorance, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t upset you\u00e2\u0080\u0093well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the real sign that you have begun to be a philosopher.

Every man was controlled by one thought only: to keep himself alive for the family waiting for him at home, and to save his friends. With no hesitation, therefore, he would arrange for another prisoner, another \u00e2\u0080\u009cnumber,\u00e2\u0080\u009d to take his place in the transport.",
            "The privilege of actually smoking cigarettes was reserved for the Capo, who had his assured quota of weekly coupons; or possibly for a prisoner who worked as a foreman in a warehouse or workshop and received a few cigarettes in exchange for doing dangerous jobs. The only exceptions to this were those who had lost the will to live and wanted to \u00e2\u0080\u009cenjoy\u00e2\u0080\u009d their last days. Thus, when we saw a comrade smoking his own cigarettes, we knew he had given up faith in his strength to carry on, and, once lost, the will to live seldom returned.",
            "I would like to mention a few similar surprises on how much we could endure: we were unable to clean our teeth, and yet, in spite of that and a severe vitamin deficiency, we had healthier gums than ever before. We had to wear the same shirts for half a year, until they had lost all appearance of being shirts. For days we were unable to wash, even partially, because of frozen water-pipes, and yet the sores and abrasions on hands which were dirty from work in the soil did not suppurate (that is, unless there was frostbite). Or for instance, a light sleeper, who used to be disturbed by the slightest noise in the next room, now found himself lying pressed against a comrade who snored loudly a few inches from his ear and yet slept quite soundly through the noise.",
            "All of you standing here, even if you have only been here twenty-four hours, you need not fear gas, except perhaps you.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And then he pointed to me and said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cI hope you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind my telling you frankly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d To the others he repeated, \u00e2\u0080\u009cOf all of you he is the only one who must fear the next selection. So, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry!\u00e2\u0080\u009d And I smiled. I am now convinced that anyone in my place on that day would have done the same.

            "A thought transfixed me: for the first time in my life I saw the truth as it is set into song by so many poets, proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers. The truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094that love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.",
            "The salvation of man is through love and in love.",
            "As the inner life of the prisoner tended to become more intense, he also experienced the beauty of art and nature as never before. Under their influence he sometimes even forgot his own frightful circumstances. If someone had seen our faces on the journey from Auschwitz to a Bavarian camp as we beheld the mountains of Salzburg with their summits glowing in the sunset, through the little barred windows of the prison carriage, he would never have believed that those were the faces of men who had given up all hope of life and liberty. Despite that factor\u00e2\u0080\u0094or maybe because of it\u00e2\u0080\u0094we were carried away by nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty, which we had missed for so long.",
            "In Auschwitz I had laid down a rule for myself which proved to be a good one and which most of my comrades later followed. I generally answered all kinds of questions truthfully. But I was silent about anything that was not expressly asked for.",
            "Many weeks later we found out that even in those last hours fate had toyed with us few remaining prisoners. We found out just how uncertain human decisions are, especially in matters of life and death. I was confronted with photographs which had been taken in a small camp not far from ours. Our friends who had thought they were traveling to freedom that night had been taken in the trucks to this camp, and there they were locked in the huts and burned to death. Their partially charred bodies were recognizable on the photograph. I thought again of Death in Teheran.",

            "We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms\u00e2\u0080\u0094to choose one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own way.",
            "If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.",
            "We have stated that that which was ultimately responsible for the state of the prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner self was not so much the enumerated psychophysical causes as it was the result of a free decision.",
            "It became easy to overlook the opportunities to make something positive of camp life, opportunities which really did exist. Regarding our \u00e2\u0080\u009cprovisional existence\u00e2\u0080\u009d as unreal was in itself an important factor in causing the prisoners to lose their hold on life; everything in a way became pointless. Such people forgot that often it is just such an exceptionally difficult external situation which gives man the opportunity to grow spiritually beyond himself. Instead of taking the camp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s difficulties as a test of their inner strength, they did not take their life seriously and despised it as something of no consequence. They preferred to close their eyes and to live in the past. Life for such people became meaningless.",
            "One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.",

            "As we said before, any attempt to restore a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal. Nietzsche\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,\u00e2\u0080\u009d could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners.",
            "it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life\u00e2\u0080\u0094daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct.",
            "When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.",
            "Once the meaning of suffering had been revealed to us, we refused to minimize or alleviate the camp\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tortures by ignoring them or harboring false illusions and entertaining artificial optimism. Suffering had become a task on which we did not want to turn our backs. We had realized its hidden opportunities for achievement, the opportunities which caused the poet Rilke to write, \u00e2\u0080\u009cWie viel ist aufzuleiden!\u00e2\u0080\u009d (How much suffering there is to get through!). Rilke spoke of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgetting through suffering\u00e2\u0080\u009d as others would talk of \u00e2\u0080\u009cgetting through work.\u00e2\u0080\u009d There was plenty of suffering for us to get through. Therefore, it was necessary to face up to the full amount of suffering, trying to keep moments of weakness and furtive tears to a minimum."
